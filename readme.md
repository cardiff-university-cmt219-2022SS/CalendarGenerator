# This is optimized calendar

> Calendar for 2021-2022 Cardiff University `Computing` and `Computing & IT Management` Spring Semester.
> 
> This calendar includes all the optional modules. Because school's calendar subscription has a lot of confused drop- in session, 
> and union apps cannot be perfectly integrated into native system-level applications, so I began to write a little tool to regenerate 
> an ics file to integrate with other applications.
> 
> This calendar already support apple calendar, Microsoft Outlook calendar and google calendar.
> 
> Of course, this file is based on the iCalendar standard, so that means you can subscribe this calendar by any application you like which supports iCalendar standard.
